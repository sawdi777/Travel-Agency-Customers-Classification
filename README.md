# Travel Agency Customer Classification

🎉 This repository contains a project focused on classifying whether a travel agency customer is likely to return and make another transaction with the same agency. By leveraging Travel Customer Churn data, we experimented with multiple classification methods and fine-tuned them to achieve the best possible accuracy. 🌟

This project was completed as part of a collaborative effort with one of my students, who carried out the analysis and implementation under my guidance. It serves as an excellent example of applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems. This is his Github Username: @Roozbehzare💡

## Project Overview

🚀 The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will return to the travel agency for future transactions. This is a critical business problem for travel agencies aiming to maximize customer retention and long-term profitability. We used various machine learning classification algorithms and systematically fine-tuned them to ensure high accuracy and reliability. 🌐

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation

📂 The dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
- Missing values are handled using imputation methods.
- Categorical variables are encoded appropriately (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding). 🌟

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🔍 Key insights are derived from visualizing customer behaviors and trends.
- Distributions, correlations, and outlier analyses are conducted.
- Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots are used to explore relationships between features and the target variable. 📈

### 3. Feature Engineering

🛠️ Feature importance is analyzed to select the most impactful predictors.
- New features are created by combining or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance. 🚀

### 4. Model Training

📑 Several classification models are tested, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks

Each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 🌟

### 5. Model Fine-Tuning

🔧 Hyperparameter optimization is performed using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- The best-performing model is selected based on cross-validation results. 🎯
